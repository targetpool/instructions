# How to download and create your ADA wallet

You can delegate ADA to a stake pool like ours TRGT using Daedalus in a few quick and easy steps.

The proof of stake protocol allows users to be rewarded in ADA for helping to validate blocks on the network, similar to how Bitcoin and Ethereum validate their networks with mining, rewarding miners in their respective tokens.

The process of staking is easy and risk free.

Users that are holding ADA can simply load a wallet using Daedalus or other popular Cardano wallets such as Yoroi, delegate ADA to a Stake Pool and receive rewards in the process.

You can follow these easy steps to get started with delegating your ADA to a Stake Pool. In this tutorial we will be using a Daedalus wallet. Daedalus is a full node wallet. This means that unlike light wallets \(e.g.Yoroi, Adalite etc.\) Daedalus downloads a full copy of the Cardano blockchain and independently validates every transaction in its history. That way you get maximum security and completely trustless operation, without centrally hosted 3rd party servers.
