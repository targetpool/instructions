# Welcome

**Welcome to the best Cardano training resource on the internet.**   
  
We create our own Cardano training material in 3 languages Russian, German and English! 

For Russian and German speakers we also translate Cardano articles and post them under the relevant section on our website and on the Cardano Forum under username timkrav [https://forum.cardano.org/t/ada-cardano/51221](https://forum.cardano.org/t/ada-cardano/51221)

Since each language site is maintained separately I put in a lot of work into this! If you are in process of setting up your Cardano node, this process is not quick, so we would appreciate it if you would support our work by staking your ADA in the meantime with our pool Target ticker \(TRGT\) 

You will need a lot of technical knowledge to run and operate your pool, if you feel that this process is a little overwhelming we would appreciate your stake with our pool TRGT it is also very rewarding!

Best of luck with your endeavor!
